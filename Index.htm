<h3> As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to 
simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure 
it to display.<br>
Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like 
headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information

in HTML language.<br></h3>
